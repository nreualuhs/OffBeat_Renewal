What did I do: 
- I created my own branch (joey)
- set up file structure with a separate client and server folder
- spent majority of time setting up the client side for basic navigation using BrowserReact from React
- no html/css/aesthetic refinement of how it looks
- successfuly navigate to other pages using button
- implemented timer function using Michelle's code from last project
- flowmap of potentially how the game goes
